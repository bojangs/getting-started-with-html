    <b>The Web/Internet</b>
  <p>The Internet is essentially a collection of HTML documents--it's comprised of hundreds of thousands of computers that communicate with each other.  It was invented in the early 90's and has approximately <b><u>30 billion</b></u> web pages!</p>
  <p>Here's a highly entertaining video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWDUIypHq5o">how the Internet works</a>!</p>

<b>HTML</b>
  <p>Stands for HyperText Markup Language--it's the glue that holds everything together on the Internet.  It's made up of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Text content - What you see</li>
  <li>Markup - What it looks like</li>
  <li>References to other docs - Images, videos, and more!</li>
</ul>

<b>HTTP</b>
<p>A simple protocol used by an Internet browser to consume content.  When trying to access a web page, the Internet browser sends an HTTP request to a web server via the Internet.  The web server locates the requested HTML content and sends it back to the browser.  The browser then translates the HTML and displays the content on the computer.</p>


<b>Inline and Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements can be either inline or block.  Inline elements are just as they sound, direct inline modifications, whereas block elements draw an invisible box around the content which can have it's height, width, and more modified.</p>
